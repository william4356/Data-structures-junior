Multi-Dimensional Hash tables is a data structure I created with O(1) efficiency for resizing which means insert has O(1) efficiency worst case.
which is theoretically the most efficient data Structure, but as seen in MDHTEfficiencyTester.java it is not in practice
 Once A MDHT object is created it can have data added by using the insert method,
 deleted by using the delete method, returned individually using the getValue method,
 and checked using the contains method. MDHT also has a toString method that prints out all data layer by layer.
 The Pair sub-class is how all data is packaged.
 The SwitchArray sub-class is what all the data is put into which is the backbone for MDHT.
